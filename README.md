 GreyScale
 ==========
 Fill in the kernel to convert from color to greyscale
 
 Image Blurring
 ===============
 A gaussian_blur CUDA kernel to perform a 2D image blurring operation 
   
 Tone-mapping
 ===============
 Perform tone mapping on a HDR image i.e 
 transform the luminance channel by compressing its range to [0, 1].
  
  
 Seamless Clonning
 ==================
 Paste the source image into destination thereby matching the two images 
 so that the pasting is non-obvious.
   
 Red Eye Removal
 =================
 Implementing red eye removal

 Optimization techniques CUDA
 ===============================
 The goal of this project is compute a histogram
 as fast as possible.
